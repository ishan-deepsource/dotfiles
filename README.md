# My personal dotfiles

My personal dotfiles. A trim down version of [Freek Van der Herten](https://freek.dev/)'s [dotfiles](https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles).

It contains the installation of some basic tools, some handy aliases and functions.

You can install them by cloning the repository as `.dotfiles` in your home directory and running the bootstrap script.

```
git clone git@github.com:ishan-deepsource/dotfiles.git .dotfiles
cd .dotfiles
./bootstrap
```

The bootstrap script can be run by cd-ing into the `.dotfiles` directory and performing this command:

```bash
./bootstrap
```
